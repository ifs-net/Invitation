"The Invitation module is a small zikula module that allows your users to "
"invite friends. They can send invitations to email addresses they know. Each "
"email address can only be invited for one time - if another user invited the "
"same person the last 2 months the person will not get a new invitation. The "
"email addresses are stored as md5 hash and whenever a new user profile was "
"created the user's email address will be compared with the stored hash and "
"on success the information will be stored for the new user who invited him. "
"You can specify some lines of text that will be added to every email that "
"goes out as invitation."
